# Linear calculations (Shapes 2)

## Task 1
Find square's area following the formula: **S = a²**
```
Example: а = 4   area = 16
```

## Task 2
Find the circumference **_L_** and the area of a circle **_S_** of a given radius using the formula **L = 2 × π × r** ,  **S = π × R²**, where **_π = 3.14_**.
```
Example: r = 5   circumference = 31.4
         r = 5   area = 78.5
```

## Task 3
The cuboid`s edges are **_a,  b,  c_**. Find its volume using the formula: **V = a × b × c**. 

Find its surface area following the formula: **S = 2×(a×b + b×c + a×c)**.
```
Example: а = 4, b = 2, c = 3   volume = 24
         а = 4, b = 2, c = 3   surface area = 52
```
